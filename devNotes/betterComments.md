# Cheat Sheet for Better Comments Extension

There are 5 major ways to comment using this extension and they are as followed:

 ```bash
// ! ALERT         (important / risky / breaking)
// ? QUESTION      (uncertain / investigate / why?)
// TODO: TASK      (thing to do later)        // tag is "todo" by default
// * HIGHLIGHT     (important note / key idea)
// // STRIKEOUT    (commented-out code; shown as “shouldn’t be there”)

/*
 ! ALERT in multiline (works if better-comments.multilineComments = true)
 ? QUESTION
 TODO: TASK
 * HIGHLIGHT
 // STRIKEOUT
*/
```

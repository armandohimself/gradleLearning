# Today's Notes

- Set learning and debug profiles with shortcut commands so I can switch fast.
- Installed Gradle with: `brew install gradle` (I’m on 9.2.1)
- Turned Copilot completely off for learning.
- Created a `.gitignore` file with best practices.
- Started a `build.gradle` file with simple learning examples.


## Noted Learnings
1. Gradle build = 1+ Gradle projects
2. Gradle project = depends on what Gradle is being used to build  
   - `build.gradle` is the script where you define/configure the project
3. Project examples = building a JAR (or other distributable), generating docs, testing, deploying, etc.
4. `build.gradle` is usually written in **`Groovy`**
   - Gradle can also use **`Kotlin`** with `build.gradle.kts`
5. `tasks` = units of work inside a project  
   - Examples: compile classes, run unit tests, build a JAR  
   - Task code is written in the same language as your build script (Groovy or Kotlin)
6. Gradle looks for the build script in the project folder  
   > Default script name is `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts` for Kotlin)
7. `-q` in `gradle -q hello` = “quiet mode” (reduces Gradle’s log output)
